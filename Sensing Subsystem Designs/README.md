# Sensing Subsystem Designs - Micro-Mouse Project

## Overview
This directory contains all the necessary design files for the Sensing Subsystem of the Micro-Mouse Project. It includes PCB design files, production resources such as bill of materials (BOM) and Gerber files for manufacturing the final design. The purpose of this subsystem is to enable the micro-mouse to detect obstacles within the maze environment effectively.

## File Structure

### `/Sensing Subsystem Designs/`
- **README.md**: This document, detailing the file structure and purpose of each item.
- **Sensing_Subsystem_Group_8.kicad_pcb**: KiCad PCB design file for the sensing subsystem.
- **Sensing_Subsystem_Group_8.kicad_prl**: KiCad project local file, storing project-specific settings.
- **Sensing_Subsystem_Group_8.kicad_pro**: KiCad project file, which contains setup and configuration for the sensing subsystem project.
- **Sensing_Subsystem_Group_8.kicad_sch**: KiCad schematic file for the sensing subsystem.
- **sym-lib-table**: KiCad symbol library table file, listing all symbol libraries used in the project.

### `/Production Resources/`
- Contains BOM and Gerber files necessary for the production of the sensing subsystem. These are critical for manufacturing and assembly of the designed PCB.
